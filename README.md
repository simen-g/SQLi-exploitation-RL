# SQLi-exploitation-RL

Development of a reinforcement learning agent that exploits a SQL injection vulnerability on a vulnerable webpage.

Credits to https://github.com/FMZennaro/CTF-SQL for the fundaments of the reinforcement learning agent, and to Robert Chetwyn (https://github.com/chetwynr) for development of the web server.

## Usage

The vulnerable web server is built as a Docker container. This version is tested and working on Docker Desktop for MacOS Monterrey.
Start the vulnerable web server on port 8000 by running:
> website/rlctf_arena_main/env_logic.py

Then run agent.py to exploit the vulnerability. To get a list of basic options and switches run:
> agent.py -h

To see a list of all possible actions the agent can make run:
>generate_actions.py
